# Knapsack problem

The knapsack problem is a problem in [combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization): Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size [knapsack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack) and must fill it with the most valuable items. The problem often arises in [resource allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_allocation) where the decision makers have to choose from a set of non-divisible projects or tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint, respectively.

The knapsack problem has been studied for more than a century, with early works dating as far back as 1897.[1] The name "knapsack problem" dates back to the early works of the mathematician [Tobias Dantzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Dantzig) (1884â€“1956),[2] and refers to the commonplace problem of packing the most valuable or useful items without overloading the luggage.
